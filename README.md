# TL;DR

A Repository for learning data structures and algorithms in different languages. I want to make this comprehensive for myself and anyone interested in learning stuff. This can eventually turn into a repository where this becomes a one stop shop for resources pertaining to a programming language.
My intention behind this repositorys are:

1. Learning data structures, implementing stuff in different languages to improve proficency.
2. Learning the build process/ compilation process for different languages, just the idiomatic way of setting up module imports etc.
3. Learn testing, and the best way to TDD for different languages. Like golang has a built in testing , javascript has jest, rust has a built in testing support,
python has unitttest etc...

| Least Recently Used Cache |          Yes                   |     Improve Tests       |


## Improvements

-  Actively getting good at golang by implementing all new stuff in it.
-  Improve Golang code structure by using interfaces.
-  Better Test suites accross the board
